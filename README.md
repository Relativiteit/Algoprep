# Algoprep
Data structures and algorithm questions start of studying on 03-06-2021
### Week 1 Arrays 03-06-2021 -- 10-06-2021
Main focus this week will be arrays in python3 and starting a habbit of leetcode.
- [x] 1480. Running Sum of 1d Array 03-06-2021 
### Week 2 Arrays 17-06-2021 -- 24-06-2021
Same objective as last week. Leason learned: take time to read the questions especially the examples to understand the transformations of the data.
- [x] 1431. Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies
- [x] 1470. Shuffle the array
- [x] 1672. Richest Cosutomer Wealth 
- [x] 1512. Number of good pairs
- [x] 1365. How Many Numbers Are Smaller Than the Current Number

- [x] 1313. Decompress Run-Lenght encoded list 

### Week 3 25-06-2021 -- 02-07-2021
