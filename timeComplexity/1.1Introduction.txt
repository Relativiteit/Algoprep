First design then you write the program 

Introduction to algorithms

Algorithms
Design time (first design) 
Domain knowledge
Any language 
Hardware and OS independent
Analyze the algorithm 

Program
Implementation time
Programmer
Programmer language (C++ JAVA PYthon)
Depended on Hardware and OS
Testing of the program 

1.1 Priori analysis and posteriori Testing

Priori Analysis
Algorithm
Independent of Language
Hardware Independent
Time & Space Function 

Posteriori Testing
Program
Language dependent 
Hardware dependent
Watch time & bytes

1.2 Characteristics of Algorithm

Characteristics of Algorithm 
Input - 0 or more
Output - at least 1 output 
Definiteness - (every state must me clear)
Finiteness - (every algorithm must stop)
Effectiveness 

1.3 How Write and Analyze Algorithm 

How to write an Algorithm 
Algorithm swap(a,b)
    temp = a;
    a = b;
    b = temp;

How to analyze an algorithm
Time 
Space
Network consumption (how much data it consumes)
Power consumption 
CPU Registers 


How to analyze an Algorithm 
Algorithm swap(a,b)                Space 
    temp = a;        1        a - 1
    a = b;           1        b - 1
    b = temp;        1        temp -1

        f(n) =       3        s(n)=3 words
x= 5 * a + 6 * b   1 O(1)        O(1) 


O(1) when the value is constant, does not matter if s(n) or f(n) are 3*210930293 or 1 a constant will give O(1).
